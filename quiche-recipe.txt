Basic quiche recipe

pie crust: I use the Pillsbury ones in the red box
I pre-bake them for 3 mins at 400, then prick with fork, then 5 more minutes at 400 if you don't, the crust might be underdone and have a weird texture
(then turn the oven down to 350 for the quiche)
basic filling for all my quiches:
two cups grated swiss cheese (that's 1/2 of one of those standard blocks of swiss - the 1 lb ones, I think) 3 eggs
1 and 1/3 cups of milk (I use skim but you can make it extra rich with heavier milk or part cream)
1 tsp of salt
1/8 tsp of nutmeg (this is standard for quiche Lorraine, but I use it in all my quiches)
a little pepper (8-10 turns on the pepper mill or maybe 1/8 tsp)
For quiche Lorraine, you add:
cooked (and chopped up) bacon (4 slices is probably enough, but put as much as you like) chopped and sautéed onions (maybe 1/2 an onion or a little less)
For other quiches, instead of bacon and onion, add any combinations of other stuff you like: - broccoli and/or ham
- sautéed veggies (onion, bell peppers)
- turkey and asparagus
- whatever!
(you could also change up the type of cheese or mix different types to come up with 2 cups)
to build it:
put about half of the cheese in the bottom of the crust
spread the bacon and onion (or whatever other combination) over that top with the rest of the cheese
mix up the milk, eggs, salt, pepper, nutmeg together in a bowl or pitcher pour that mixture over everything else
bake for about 50 mins - the cheese should be golden and a little crusty on top
a knife stuck in the middle should come out wet, but not sticky/goopy, when done let it sit for 10-15 mins to firm up a little
it will firm up more later and in the fridge
